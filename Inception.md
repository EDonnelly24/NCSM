Introduction
Our project is about making a web app that can be used by students so that they can develop a community that best fits them within the University they are attending. This software will be solving the problem that some students may have on campus of connecting with others and finding friends in university life. This can be a big problem with some students whether they be transfers or incoming freshman as connecting with your community can be daunting to some but being connected with life on campus can make a students college experience that much better.

Initial value proposition and consumer segments
Value Proposition: Communication and connectivity in your pocket. Meet people at your new school with ease!

Consumer Segments: 
We initially believed that this app would be most useful for students and clubs on campus.
