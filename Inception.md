D1. Inception

1. Introduction

  Our project is about making a web app that can be used by students so that they can develop a community that best fits them within the 
University they are attending. This software will be solving the problem that some students may have on campus of connecting with others 
and finding friends in university life. This can be a big problem with some students whether they be transfers or incoming freshman as 
connecting with your community can be daunting to some but being connected with life on campus can make a students college experience 
that much better.
